**Colorectal Cancer: Visualizing the Impact of Diet and Lifestyle Factors**

This project explores how diet and lifestyle factors contribute to colorectal cancer (CRC) risk using visual data analysis techniques. Colorectal cancer is strongly influenced by modifiable behaviors such as dietary habits, physical activity, smoking, and overall metabolic health. By analyzing the Colorectal Cancer Dietary and Lifestyle Dataset (CRC-DLD), this study aims to uncover meaningful patterns and relationships that illustrate how everyday choices may influence disease outcomes.

Through a combination of exploratory visualization, summary statistics, and comparative analysis across demographic, nutritional, and lifestyle variables, the project investigates which factors are most strongly associated with elevated CRC risk. The goal is to provide clear visual insights that help communicate how modifiable behaviors relate to this major public health concern, supporting greater awareness and informed decision-making around prevention and early detection.
